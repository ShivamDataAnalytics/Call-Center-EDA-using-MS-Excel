# Call-Center-EDA-using-MS-Excel

Here I am presenting one of the recent Excel Data Analysis Projects that I have worked on. 
It's about different Call Centers situated in different regions of the U.S.A  

Project Task - To perform EDA regarding the call centers for eg - to give insights regarding during which day of the week most calls happen, what is the most usable medium of communication for calls, the most common reason for calling, etc, and present it through visualization -charts & graphs.  

For the solution approach Data Analysis techniques used are : 
1) Data collection and preparation - Dataset collected from real-world fake data for call center project and stored in the local storage Link -https://lnkd.in/dEe5nyZ8   
2) Data Preprocessing and transformation did like removing unnecessary columns, adding a column, changing the alignment and data type of columns, etc.  
3) Data Analyzing - After all the preprocessing, the data is now ready for analysis. Creating Pivot tables to answer important questions and deeply display the data insights that can prove productive to the management committee.  
4) Data Visualization - After the analysis part, now converted Pivot table data into Pivot Charts for a clearer understanding of #data patterns.  Charts used - Column chart, Bar chart, Doughnut chart, line carts, and most importantly Slicers for interactive #dataviz dashboard.
